        <span>Problem -> </span>
        <p> 1. Book Recommendation App is a specific requirement of the client that integrates the buying and selling
            services
            specifically to their customers. <br>
            2. Reports can be generated at any time within few seconds, so that manual labor is not required, and
            also
            analysis can be performed much more frequently which helps in taking decision.<br>
            3. The details regarding all users, books can also be maintained as their information is very helpful
            and
